# üìà Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a **Machine Learning workflow** for predicting stock prices using historical data.  
It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions with a trained model.

## üöÄ Project Structure

- **main.py** ‚Äì Python script for training and running the ML model.  
- **ML.ipynb** ‚Äì Jupyter notebook for experimentation, visualization, and model testing.  
- **stock_predictions_model.keras** ‚Äì Pre-trained Keras model for stock price prediction.  
- **ml_workflow.png** ‚Äì Workflow diagram for the project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Stock Data Collection** ‚Äì Gather historical data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance APIs).  
2. **Data Preprocessing** ‚Äì Clean, scale, and split data into training/testing sets.  
3. **Feature Engineering** ‚Äì Create time windows and input sequences for training.  
4. **Model Training** ‚Äì Train a deep learning model (LSTM/ANN) using Keras/TensorFlow.  
5. **Model Evaluation** ‚Äì Assess model accuracy and loss metrics.  
6. **Prediction** ‚Äì Forecast future stock prices using the trained model.
