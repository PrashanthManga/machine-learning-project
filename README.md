# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a **Machine Learning workflow** for predicting stock prices using historical data.  
It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions with a trained model.

---

## 🚀 Project Structure

- **main.py** – Python script for training and running the ML model.  
- **ML.ipynb** – Jupyter notebook for experimentation, visualization, and model testing.  
- **stock_predictions_model.keras** – Pre-trained Keras model for stock price prediction.  

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Gather historical stock data.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean, scale, and prepare data for model training.  
3. **Model Training** – Train a deep learning model using Keras/TensorFlow.  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Assess accuracy, loss, and performance metrics.  
5. **Prediction** – Generate future stock price predictions.
